Automated Credit Card Approval Predictor

Commercial banks receive a high volume of credit card applications, many of which are rejected due to various factors such as high loan balances, low income levels, or excessive credit inquiries. Manual application analysis is both tedious and error-prone, making it essential to automate the process, especially considering the value of time in the banking industry. Fortunately, machine learning offers a solution, and almost every commercial bank leverages this technology today.

In this GitHub repository, we present a data science project focused on building an automatic credit card approval predictor using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, mirroring real-world bank practices. Our project employs the Credit Card Approval dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Project Structure:

- Data Loading and Overview:
We begin by loading and inspecting the dataset.
The dataset encompasses a mix of numerical and non-numerical features, varying value ranges, and missing entries.

- Data Preprocessing:
Ensuring data quality is crucial, so we preprocess the dataset to prepare it for machine learning.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We delve into exploratory data analysis to gain insights and develop our intuitions about the data.

- Machine Learning Model Development:
We build a robust machine learning model capable of predicting credit card approval outcomes.
